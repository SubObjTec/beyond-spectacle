Beyond Spectacle marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of the key texts
of the Situationist International, Guy Debord's _The Society of the Spectacle_
and Raoul Vaneigem's _The Revolution of Everyday Life_. It will feature
speakers, creation and exhibition of art works, film screenings, and other
events.

[The Institute for the Humanities](http://www.sfu.ca/humanities-institute.html){:target="blank"}
of Simon Fraser University and
[Cinevolution Media Arts Society](http://cinevolutionmedia.com){:target="blank"}
will collaboratively host Beyond Spectacle as a free public event in Vancouver,
Coast Salish territories, Canada, in April, 2017.

### Conference

The conference portion of the event, titled Spectacle of Fascism, will present
discussions by invited scholars examining the contributions of the
Situationists within the context of ongoing changes in the global political
landscape.

### Residency

We are now accepting proposals for artistic projects. Please feel free to
circulate widely our [Call for Proposals](./call-for-proposals).

__*Submissions are now closed. Thank you.*__

### Free School

Leading up to and following the Spectacle of Fascism conference and Beyond
Spectacle residency, the Institute for the Humanities is proud to present
Spectre of Fascism, a 'free school' of weekly speaking engagements with local
volunteer scholars. In each week of this series a different speaker will
undertake historical, theoretical, or diagnostic examination of fascism past and
present, followed by a structured Q&A session and generous time for
discussion, socializing, and organizing. Details will be publicized soon. These
engagements will take place at UNIT/PITT Gallery and other venues, and will be
free and open to the public.
