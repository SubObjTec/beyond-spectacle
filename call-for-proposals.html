          Welcome to Beyond Spectacle, a hybrid conference/residency

            The Situationist International
          </a>

          <strong>OPEN CALL FOR PROPOSALS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “As long as necessity is socially dreamed, dreaming will remain a
          social necessity.” — Guy Debord,
          <i>The Society of the Spectacle</i>
          Aphorism 21
        </p>
        <p>
          In conjunction with the conference Beyond Spectacle organized by the
          Institute for the Humanities of Simon Fraser University, Cinevolution
          invites proposals from local, national and international interested
          persons to present projects for a residency to take place in
          <strong>Vancouver, BC, from April 3rd to April 9th, 2017.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Situationist International (SI) was a movement of (anti-)artists,
          thinkers and activists who, between 1957 and 1972, produced films and
          publications that critically addressed what they termed the
          “spectacular commodity-society.” The conference will explore how the
          spectacle remains a pertinent concept from which to criticize
          contemporary experience. From the dismantling of the welfare state
          concurring with an international rise of fascism to the pressure of
          new technologies that embody a neoliberal performance of oneself,
          social relations are mediated by images to an increasing degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeking to engage the legacy of the SI, this “open residency” will
          combine theory and artistic practice in order to create a cooperative
          space for the critical analysis of society. Opening prior to the
          conference and continuing throughout and afterwards, the residency
          will operate as a workshop for critical dialogue and experimentation.
          Visiting participants will be introduced to local participants prior
          to the residency start, as well as to scholar advisors. Conference
          attendees will be invited to participate in the proposed situations,
          and residents will be invited to intervene in conference proceedings,
          creating a dynamic environment to share ideas and projects.
        </p>
        <p>

              Contingent upon funding, participants will be remunerated

              will be expected to debut an original work or performance for

              additional support to do so. Works should be in thematic unity
              with the residency and related programming, and collaboration
              is encouraged.

              <p>
                Although we welcome submissions from outside Vancouver, we are
                unable to compensate travel expenses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Applicants are encouraged to apply for travel funding from other
                sources. For example, Canada Council for the Arts offers support
                for travel expenses via their
                <a href='http://canadacouncil.ca/funding/grants/arts-across-canada/travel' target='_blank'>
                  Arts Across Canada Travel grant
                </a>
                and the expiring
                <a href='http://canadacouncil.ca/funding/grants/expiring-programs' target='_blank'>
                  Travel Grant for Artists
                </a>
                programmes (most pertinently, that for Inter-Arts). If you wish
                to apply to either of these, please contact us for support as
                soon as possible. The deadline for the expiring programmes is
                January 31st. There is no fixed deadline for the Arts Across
                Canada programme, but the application is lengthy and should be
                started soon.

        <p>
          <strong>Selection</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The participants selected will be notified via e-mail or telephone by
          February 14th. After that date, the organizers will discuss project
          conditions with the selected participants, as well as production and
          installation costs if applicable. The list of participants selected
          will be published on organizers’ websites, as well as via other means
          of communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects will be selected by a jury of arts professionals
          according to feasibility and criticality. We also encourage proposals
          outside of the above-mentioned suggestions or those challenging the
          proposed framework. Applicants interested in public action should
          highlight that in their proposals. Priority will be given to
          participants who are in an on-going dialog with critical theories and
          interested in sharing their knowledge. This event welcomes
          participants from all origins, gender, sexual orientation, faith and
          ability.
