          Welcome to Beyond Spectacle, a hybrid conference/artist residency
          activating the intellectual, artistic, and activist legacy of

            The Situationist International
          </a>
          to address political concerns of the present.

          <strong>OPEN CALL FOR CONTRIBUTIONS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “As long as necessity is socially dreamed, dreaming will remain a
          social necessity.” — Guy Debord,
          <i>The Society of the Spectacle</i>
          Aphorism 21
        </p>
        <p>
          In conjunction with the conference Beyond Spectacle organized by the
          Institute for the Humanities of Simon Fraser University, Cinevolution
          invites artists – local, national and international – to present
          projects for an artist residency to take place in
          <strong>Vancouver, BC, from March 30th to April 9th, 2017.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Situationist International (SI) was a movement of artists,
          thinkers and activists who, between 1957 and 1972, produced films and
          publications that critically addressed what they termed the
          “spectacular commodity-society.” The conference will explore how the
          spectacle remains a pertinent concept from which to criticize
          contemporary experience. From the collapse of the nation-state
          concurring with an international rise of fascism to the pressure of
          new technologies that embody a neoliberal performance of oneself,
          social relations are mediated by images to an increasing degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeking to engage the legacy of the SI, this “open residency” will
          combine theory and artistic practice in order to create a cooperative
          space for the critical analysis of society. Opening prior to the
          conference and continuing throughout and afterwards, the residency
          will operate as a workshop for critical dialogue and experimentation.
          Visiting artists will be paired with local artists, and matched with
          scholar advisors. Conference attendees will be invited to participate
          in the proposed situations, and resident artists will be invited to
          intervene in conference p!roceedings, creating a dynamic environment
          to share ideas and projects.
        </p>

          <strong>*PLEASE NOTE:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Late submissions will not be considered.</li>
            <li>
              Although we welcome submissions from outside Vancouver, we are
              unable to compensate travel expenses. Contingent upon funding,
              artists will be remunerated according to industry standards; in
              this case, artists will be expected to debut an original work or
              performance for public exhibition during the residency, and will
              receive additional support to do so. Works should be in thematic
              unity with the residency and related programming, and
              collaboration is encouraged.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Selection</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The participants selected will be notified via e-mail or telephone by
          February 14th. After that date, the organizers will discuss project
          conditions with the selected participants, as well as production and
          installation costs if applicable. The list of participants selected
          will be published on organizers’ websites, as well as via other means
          of communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects will be selected by a jury of arts professionals
          according to feasibility and criticality. We also encourage proposals
          outside of the above-mentioned suggestions or those challenging the
          proposed framework. Artists interested in public action should
          highlight that in their proposals. Priority will be given to
          participants who are in an on-going dialog with critical theories and
          interested in sharing their knowledge. This event welcomes
          participants from all origins, gender, sexual orientation, faith and
          ability.
