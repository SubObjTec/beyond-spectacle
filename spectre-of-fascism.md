# SPECTRE OF FASCISM

# FREE SCHOOL

### THURSDAYS, 7:00PM–10:00PM, UNIT/PITT PROJECTS, 236 E PENDER ST, VANCOUVER

*Organized by Samir Gandesha and Stephen Collis, and sponsored by SFU's
Institute for the Humanities.*

### **Note: unless otherwise noted, the sessions will take place on Thursdays at UNIT/PITT Projects from 7PM–10PM.**

With the recent election of Donald J. Trump as 45th President of the United
States, there has been a dramatic return of the word “fascism” to contemporary
analyses of politics. For example, on December 9th, 2016, Michael Kinsley,
writing for the Washington Post, openly declares that “Donald Trump is a
fascist.” In one sense, this was justified by the fact that Trump’s
administration includes Steven Bannon, former Wall Street Executive, Harvard
MBA, and avid reader of Italian fascist philosopher Julius Evola. Indeed,
Richard Spenser, one of the key neo-Nazi figures whom Bannon describes as the
“intellectual leader of the alt-right movement,” infamously greeted Trump’s
election with a version of Sieg Heil (Hail Trump) and a Nazi salute. A hard
core of Trump support is comprised of White Nationalists and White Supremacists
such as David Duke. On the other hand, Trump does not lead a tightly disciplined
mass-based party premised upon a philosophy of history entailing a social
Darwinist struggle to the death between the races and the project of
constructing an indomitable 1000-year Reich in eastern Europe. Indeed, there
seems to be little if any thought given to the prospect of the future
whatsoever, rather the vision has been consistently retrospective: “Make
America Great Again.” Globally, we have witnessed a parallel rise of
authoritarianism from the tragic denouement of the Egyptian Revolution to the
consolidation of the so-called Gujarat Model in India under the leadership of
Hindutva-backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
who has violently purged the Turkish state in the aftermath of the failed coup
last summer.

Canada, itself, has not been immune. Far from it. The agenda of the previous
Harper Government anticipated, in significant ways, the Trump Administration
from the centralization of executive power in the PMO, the use of
antidemocratic omnibus bills to push through controversial legislation
favourable to the oil and gas sector, two attempts at voter-suppression by way
of the Fair Elections Act, the silencing of scientists and librarians, the
running battle with Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin, and, of
course, draconian Anti-Terrorism Act, Islamophobia, and the invocation of “Old
Stock Canadians.”

Such developments have been understood in terms of a shift from a nominally
“democratic” to a fully “authoritarian" phase of neo-liberalism. So, this Free
School seeks to open a discussion on the question of the extent to which what
we are witnessing today is a return to classic twentieth century “fascism” or
some species of what Enzo Traverso, author of amongst other books, *The Origins
of Nazi Violence*, calls “post-fascism.” The first session will look at
theories and histories of 20th century fascism and authoritarianism, and the
second session will look to more contemporary 21st century examples. An
important underlying concern will be to think about the practical responses to
the global spread of authoritarianism.
