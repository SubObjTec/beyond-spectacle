# Beyond Spectacle
This repository hosts the online workspace and static pages presenting the public face for Beyond Spectacle, a hybrid conference/artist residency on the legacy of the Situationist International.

Beyond Spectacle is a collaborative project hosted jointly by [The Institute for the Humanities](http://www.sfu.ca/humanities-institute.html) at Simon Fraser University and [Cinevolution Media Arts Society](cinevolutionmedia.com). Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the publication of the key Situationist texts, Guy Debord's *The Society of the Spectacle* and Raoul Vaneigem's *The Revolution of Everyday Life*, as well as the 150th anniversary of the publication of the first volume of *Capital* by Karl Marx, Beyond Spectacle will feature scholarly speaking engagements, creation and exhibition of art works, film screenings, and other events. Completely free and open to the public, Beyond Spectacle will take place in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in April 2017.
