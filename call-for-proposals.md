**OPEN CALL FOR PROPOSALS**

“As long as necessity is socially dreamed, dreaming will remain a social
necessity.” — Guy Debord, _The Society of the Spectacle_ Aphorism 21

In conjunction with the conference Spectacle of Fascism organized by the
Institute for the Humanities of Simon Fraser University, Cinevolution invites
proposals from local, national and international interested persons to present
projects for a residency to take place in **Vancouver, BC, from April 3rd to
April 9th, 2017.**

The Situationist International (SI) was a movement of (anti-)artists, thinkers
and activists who, between 1957 and 1972, produced films and publications that
critically addressed what they termed the “spectacular commodity-society.” The
conference will explore how the spectacle remains a pertinent concept from
which to criticize contemporary experience. From the dismantling of the welfare
state concurring with an international rise of fascism to the pressure of new
technologies that embody a neoliberal performance of oneself, social relations
are mediated by images to an increasing degree.

Seeking to engage the legacy of the SI, this “open residency” will combine
theory and artistic practice in order to create a cooperative space for the
critical analysis of society. Opening prior to the conference and continuing
throughout and afterwards, the residency will operate as a workshop for
critical dialogue and experimentation. Visiting participants will be introduced
to local participants prior to the residency start, as well as to scholar
advisors. Conference attendees will be invited to participate in the proposed
situations, and residents will be invited to intervene in conference
proceedings, creating a dynamic environment to share ideas and projects.

A possible proposal might include:

*   Utilization of studio space
*   Creation of agitprop material
*   Critical writing practices
*   Research workshops
*   Conducting “dérives”
*   Presentation of projects for critical reception by the participants
*   Public interventions
*   Hacking practices and Internet activism

**The Residency Space**

The residency will take place at The Gold Saucer Studio,
[207 West Hastings Street, Vancouver.](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Dominion+Building,+Vancouver,+BC/@49.2828962,-123.1100036,20z){:target="blank"}

The residency will take place in a multi-purpose studio. Facilities include
tables, printer, sofa, coffee machine, Internet connection, a projector and a
library of relevant texts. Participants are invited to bring their own material
and tools. Light refreshments will be offered during the residency. The
organizers will document the residency and make this material available on a
website, which will also serve as a platform to present contributions.

**Submission**

__*Submissions are now closed. Thank you.*__

Submissions should be email to
[{{site.email}}](mailto:{{site.email}}) with the
subject line: “Beyond Spectacle Residency”.

Project proposals will be accepted until **5PM on February ~~7th~~ 10th, 2017.**
Please include the following documentation (in French or English):

1.  Applicant's name, e-mail address, telephone number, and mailing address.
For collective projects, please include the aforementioned information for each

2.  A statement no longer than 500 words containing a description of the

**PLEASE NOTE:**

*   Late submissions will not be considered.
*   Contingent upon funding, participants will be remunerated according to art
industry standards; in this case, participants will be expected to debut an
original work or performance for public exhibition during the residency, and
will receive additional support to do so. Works should be in thematic unity
with the residency and related programming, and collaboration is encouraged.
*   Although we welcome submissions from outside Vancouver, we are unable to
compensate travel expenses.

    Applicants are encouraged to apply for travel funding from other sources.
    For example, Canada Council for the Arts offers support for travel expenses
    via the
    [Arts Across Canada Travel grant](http://canadacouncil.ca/funding/grants/arts-across-canada/travel){:target="blank"}
    and the expiring
    [Travel Grant for Artists](http://canadacouncil.ca/funding/grants/expiring-programs){:target="blank"}
    programmes (most pertinently, that for Inter-Arts). If you wish to apply to
    either of these, please contact us for support as soon as possible. The
    deadline for the expiring programmes is January 31st. There is no fixed
    deadline for the Arts Across Canada programme, but the application is
    lengthy and should be started soon.

**Selection**

The participants selected will be notified via e-mail or telephone by February
14th. After that date, the organizers will discuss project conditions with the
selected participants, as well as production and installation costs if
applicable. The list of participants selected will be published on organizers’
websites, as well as via other means of communication.

The projects will be selected by a jury of arts professionals according to
feasibility and criticality. We also encourage proposals outside of the
above-mentioned suggestions or those challenging the proposed framework.
Applicants interested in public action should highlight that in their
proposals. Priority will be given to participants who are in an on-going dialog
with critical theories and interested in sharing their knowledge. This event
welcomes participants from all origins, gender, sexual orientation, faith and
ability.
